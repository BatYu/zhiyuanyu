I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I am currently working in Computer Security and Privacy Lab (CSPL) supervised by Professor Ning Zhang. My research interests include cyber-physical security, adversarial machine learning, and usable privacy. Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I received B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2019.
