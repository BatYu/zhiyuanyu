Designed lab module on physically realizable adversarial machine learning attack. The students were guided to attack autonomous vehicle equipped with Yolo recognition algorithm. They implemented adversarial training to generate adversarial patches to be physically attached on stop sign and human body. The attached stop sign and human will not be recognized by Yolo. Real world experiments were conducted on a set-up Adeept Rasptank car in a simulated city.
